## Features
-Anti ads - tries to delete most of annoying ads (70% success rate)

-Item replacer - is able to replace any item to a new one. You just type the name of item you are replacing and the new name, then after clicking a button it works as it was this item (idk how to make a better explanation)  

-Auto Craft - safe version means it most probably won't trigger too many requests error leading to not being able to fuse anything, but it depends of how many items you are fusing at once  

-Auto Craft - 429 means it has a big chance of making too many requests  
## How to use?
1. Go to https://neal.fun/infinite-craft/
2. click f12 and then open console
3. paste this code there:
```
javascript:fetch("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Pinoki8/Neal-fun-infinite-craft-item-replacer/refs/heads/main/Code").then(r=>r.text()).then(code=>eval(code));
```
(or the shorter one:)
```
javascript:fetch("https://tinyurl.com/4mh9vs82").then(r=>r.text()).then(code=>eval(code));
```

To unload the mod menu reload the pag

## Important notes:
The item you are creating might be unfusable  
Clicking on the name of the item won't do anything, so click on the emoji / anything else instead  
I don't have any more plans to this project for now.
